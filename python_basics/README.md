### What's Here? 

***Jupyter Notebooks*** that walk through basic Python foundational concepts and data structures. 
    
* Notebooks starting **00-05** can be followed workbook style by running the code blocks to demonstrate presented concepts. This set of Notebooks excludes the solutions to the Exercises. 

* Notebooks starting **S00-S05** are duplicates of the Notebooks starting **00-05**, but this set of Notebooks include the solutions to the Exercises.
