# Basic Python Programming

### Description

The UW Hyak team's non-comprehensive adaptation of Software Carpentry's [<ins>**"Plotting and Programming in Python"**</ins>](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/index.html) and [<ins>**"Programming with Python"**</ins>](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/index.html).

### What's Here? 

* Notebooks starting **01-08** can be followed workbook style by running the code blocks to demonstrate presented concepts. This set of Notebooks excludes the solutions to the Exercises. 
* Notebooks starting **S01-S08** are duplicates of the Notebooks starting **01-08**, but this set of Notebooks include the solutions to the Exercises. 
* The notebooks are meant to be a resource for your reference after the workshop has concluded. The workshop will be a hands on coding demonstration. The notebooks include additional practice exercises.
