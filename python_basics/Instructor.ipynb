Key features include a comprehensive standard library that supports a wide range of tasks such as file I/O, system calls, and Internet protocols. Python's dynamic typing and automatic memory management simplify coding and reduce errors. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Additionally, Python includes robust data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets, and provides powerful modules for handling regular expressions, mathematics, and date/time operations. Its interactive interpreter, integrated debugging, and extensive documentation make it accessible and user-friendly for both beginners and experienced developers.\n"

Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB and R start counting at 1 because that’s what human beings have done for thousands of years. Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0 because it represents an offset from the first value in the array (the second value is offset by one index from the first value). This is closer to the way that computers represent arrays (if you are interested in the historical reasons behind counting indices from zero, you can read [<ins>**Mike Hoye’s blog post**</ins>](https://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/)). As a result, if we have an M×N array in Python, its indices go from 0 to M-1 on the first axis and 0 to N-1 on the second. It takes a bit of getting used to, but one way to remember the rule is that the index is how many steps we have to take from the start to get the item we want.\n",

    "![array indexing diagram](screenshots/array_index.png 'array_indexing')\n",
    "\n",
    "What may also surprise you is that when Python displays an array, it shows the element with index `[0, 0]` in the upper left corner rather than the lower left. This is consistent with the way mathematicians draw matrices but different from the Cartesian coordinates. The indices are (row, column) instead of (column, row) for the same reason, which can be confusing when plotting data."

Referring to the functions like we did above, that is `numpy.max` for example, does not cause problems, but there are other ways to refer to them that could. In addition, text editors might highlight (color) these functions like standard library function, even though they belong to NumPy, which can be confusing and lead to errors.
