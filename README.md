# UW Molecular Engineering and Materials Center (MEMC) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Workshop Materials

### What's here? 

1. [<ins>**introduction subdirectory**</ins>](https://github.com/UWrc/MEMC-REU/tree/main/introduction)

We will be using UW-IT Research Computing's implementation of [<ins>**Open OnDemand**</ins>](https://openondemand.org/) (OOD) for this training series. OOD is a web-based portal that provides an integrated, single access point for access to the Hyak Klone HPC Cluster. OOD provides a graphical user interface (GUI) as an alternative to the command line that simplifies the process of submitting jobs, managing files, launching applications, and monitoring job status. Access our implementation at [<ins>**https://ondemand.hyak.uw.edu/**</ins>](https://ondemand.hyak.uw.edu/).

In order to access OOD you need to have an account on the Hyak cluster. If you don't have an account, check out our documentation [<ins>**here**</ins>](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/account-creation).

Introductory materials include: 
* [<ins>**00-connect-vpn.ipynb**</ins>](https://github.com/UWrc/MEMC-REU/blob/main/introduction/00-connect-vpn.ipynb) - Instructions for connecting to the UW VPN. A VPN connection is required for using Open OnDemand outside of the UW campus network. 
* [<ins>**01-start-jupyter.ipynb**</ins>](https://github.com/UWrc/MEMC-REU/blob/main/introduction/01-start-jupyter.ipynb) - Instructions for launching a JupyterLab session on Hyak's OOD platform.
* [<ins>**02-introduction.ipynb**</ins>](https://github.com/UWrc/MEMC-REU/blob/main/introduction/02-introduction.ipynb) - An introduction to Jupyter Notebooks. 

2. [<ins>**python_basics subdirectory**</ins>](https://github.com/UWrc/MEMC-REU/tree/main/python_basics)
* Jupyter notebooks were adapted from  Software Carpentry's [<ins>**"Plotting and Programming in Python"**</ins>](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/index.html) and [<ins>**"Programming with Python"**</ins>](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/index.html).
    * Notebooks starting **01-08** can be followed workbook style by running the code blocks to demonstrate presented concepts. This set of Notebooks excludes the solutions to the Exercises. 
    * Notebooks starting **S01-S08** are duplicates of the Notebooks starting **01-08**, but this set of Notebooks include the solutions to the Exercises. 
* The notebooks are meant to be a resource for your reference after the workshop has concluded. The workshop will be a hands on coding demonstration. The notebooks include additional practice exercises. 

3. [<ins>**python_plotting subdirectory**</ins>](https://github.com/UWrc/MEMC-REU/tree/main/python_plotting)
* Learning materials were adapted from [<ins>**"Plotting and Programming in Python"**</ins>](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/index.html) by Software Carpentry and [<ins>**"Python Data Science Handbook"**</ins>](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html) by Jake VanderPlas.
    * Notebook starting **00-02** can be followed workbook style by running the code blocks to demonstrate presented concepts.
    * Notebook starting **S00-S02** are duplicates of the Notebooks starting 01-08, with the solutions to the Exercises included.
* The notebooks are meant to be a resource for your reference after the workshop has concluded. The workshop will be a hands on coding demonstration. The notebooks include additional practice exercises.

4. **analysis sub-directory**
* Complete Jupyter Notebook
* Jupyter Notebook with "TODO" or in-session code boxes for demonstration.
