* Jupyter notebooks were adapted from  Software Carpentry's "Plotting and Programming in Python".
    * Notebooks starting **00-08** can be followed workbook style by running the code blocks to demonstrate presented concepts. This set of Notebooks excludes the solutions to the Exercises. 
    * Notebooks starting **S00-S08** are duplicates of the Notebooks starting **00-08**, but this set of Notebooks include the solutions to the Exercises. 
    * Notebooks starting **09-10** provide plotting examples from Gaussian outputs. 
* The notebooks are meant to be a resource for your reference after the workshop has concluded. The workshop will be a hands on coding demonstration. The notebooks include additional practice exercises.
