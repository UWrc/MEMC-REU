    "Jupyter Notebooks significantly enhance reproducible and transparent science by integrating code, data, and narrative in a single document. This combination allows researchers to document their computational processes, share data analyses, and visualize results in an interactive format. By making the complete workflow accessible and executable, Jupyter Notebooks enable other scientists to verify results, replicate experiments, and build upon previous work with ease, thereby fostering a collaborative and open scientific community."

    "# Using Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "To run Python, we are going to use JupyterLab where we will create Jupyter Notebooks for the remainder of this workshop. Jupyter Notebooks are common in data science and visualization and serve as a convenient common-denominator experience for running Python code interactively where we can easily view and share the results of our Python code.\n",

    "Jupyter Notebooks have several other handy features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can easily type, edit, and copy and paste blocks of code.\n",
    "* Tab complete allows you to easily access the names of things you are using and learn more about them.\n",
    "* It allows you to annotate your code with links, different sized text, bullets, etc. to make it more accessible to you and your collaborators.\n",
    "* It allows you to display figures next to the code that produces them to tell a complete story of the analysis.\n",
    "* Each notebook contains one or more cells that contain code, text, or images."

    "### The Menu Bar\n",
    "\n",
    "The Menu Bar at the top of JupyterLab has the top-level menus that expose various actions available in JupyterLab along with their keyboard shortcuts (where applicable). The following menus are included by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **File:** Actions related to files and directories such as New, Open, Close, Save, etc. The File menu also includes the option to Close and Halt (close notebook and half kernel operations).\n",
    "* **Edit**: Actions related to editing documents and other activities such as Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste, etc.\n",
    "* **View**: Actions that alter the appearance of Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "* **Run**: Actions for running code in different activities such as notebooks and code consoles (discussed below).\n",

In this lesson, we’ll be using the Jupyter ipython kernel which lets us run Python 3 code interactively."

    "### Create a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "If you followed the [**OnDemand Jupyter Instructions**](https://github.com/UWrc/CEI-REU/blob/main/python_plotting/00-start-jupyter-session.md) you have already done this once. As a reminder:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To open a new notebook click the Python 3 (ipykernel) icon under the File Menu and select *New -> Notebook*.\n",
    "* Notebook files have the extension .ipynb to distinguish them from plain-text Python programs.\n",
    "* Notebooks can be exported as Python scripts that can be run from the command line.\n",
    "* We will become familiar with how Jupyter notebooks appear. If you are interested in more details, then see the [**official notebook documentation**](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/notebook.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code vs. Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter mixes code and text in different types of blocks, called cells. We often use the term “code” to mean “the source code of software written in a language such as Python”. A “code cell” in a Notebook is a cell that contains software; a “text cell” is one that contains ordinary prose written for human beings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Command vs. Edit Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you press `Esc` and `Return` alternately, the outer border of your code cell will change from gray to blue.\n",
    "* These are the Command (gray) and Edit (blue) modes of your notebook.\n",
    "* Command mode allows you to edit notebook-level features, and Edit mode changes the content of cells.\n",
    "* When in Command mode (esc/gray),\n",
    "    * The `b` key will make a new cell below the currently selected cell.\n",
    "    * The `a` key will make one above.\n",
    "    * The `x` key will delete the current cell.\n",
    "    * The `z` key will undo your last cell operation (which could be a deletion, creation, etc).\n",
    "* All actions can be done using the menus, but there are lots of keyboard shortcuts to speed things up.\n",
    "* Pressing the `Return` key turns the border blue and engages Edit mode, which allows you to type within the cell.\n",
    "* Because we want to be able to write many lines of code in a single cell, pressing the `Return` key when in Edit mode (blue) moves the cursor to the next line in the cell just like in a text editor.\n",
    "* We need some other way to tell the Notebook we want to run what’s in the cell.\n",
    "* Pressing `Shift`+`Return` together will execute the contents of the cell.\n",
    "* Notice that the `Return` and `Shift` keys on the right of the keyboard are right next to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mardown\n",
    "\n",
    "* Notebooks can also render [**Markdown**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). A simple plain-text format for writing lists, links, and other things that might go into a web page. Equivalently, a subset of HTML that looks like what you’d send in an old-fashioned email.\n",
    "* Turn the current cell into a Markdown cell by entering the Command mode (`Esc`/gray) and press the `M` key. In [ ]: will disappear to show it is no longer a code cell and you will be able to write in Markdown.\n",
